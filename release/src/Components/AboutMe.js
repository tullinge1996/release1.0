          <h1>About me!</h1>
          <p> Hello! My name is Carl Brunng√•rd and I'm 21 years old  from Stockholm Sweden.
            I am currently studying to become a Front-End developer at KYH Stockholm.
            This course is stretching over 2 years and I'm just about to finish my first year.
            During this first year i have managed to gather a good amount of experience within several
            programming languages. This means that I'm on my way to become a well-rounded Front-End developer.
            Before i decided to hop on this course i had never touched code in my life, so far it has been a bit of a challenge
            to get into coding since It's very new to me. But I like to learn which i think is key for everyone who is
            thinking about getting into coding.
            Down below you can see screenshots of my previous projects.
            Also feel free to leave a comment in my Guestbook if you like.

          <h1>My skills</h1>
            <p>As a student at KYH Stockholm I've learned the basics of HTML and CSS from day one, later in my first year of studying
              i started getting more into Javascript. My lastest framework i picked up was React which this portfolio is built in.
                 </p>
