          <h1>About me!</h1>
          <p> Hello! My name is Carl Brunng√•rd and I'm 21 years old  from Stockholm Sweden.<br></br>
            I am currently studying to become a Front-End developer at KYH Stockholm.<br></br>
          This course is stretching over 2 years and I'm just about to finish my first year.<br></br>
        During this first year i have managed to gather a good amount of experience within several<br></br>
      programming languages. This means that I'm on my way to become a well-rounded Front-End developer.<br></br>
    Before i decided to hop on this course i had never touched code in my life, so far<br></br> it has been a bit of a challenge
            to get into coding since It's very new to me.<br></br> But I like to learn which i think is key for everyone who is
            thinking about getting into coding.<br></br>
          Down below you can see screenshots of my previous projects.<br></br>
            Also feel free to leave a comment in my Guestbook if you like.

          <h1>My skills</h1>
            <p>As a student at KYH Stockholm I've learned the basics of HTML and CSS from day one, later in my first year of studying
              i started getting more into Javascript. My lastest framework i picked up was React which this portfolio is built in.
                 </p>
